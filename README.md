# Engineering Manager Assignment

## Introduction
The fictional smart link company **UrlSpark** is on a journey to drive innovation in online music marketing. To keep up with the market it is crucial their engineering teams are performing well to drive new opportunities. This is a task for the Engineering Manager role, to identify how we can find ways to improve the efficiency and motivation of the two engineering teams.

### Teams
**Team A** is working on a SAAS platform that has attracted many clients and have been a big part of UrlSpark's success. The teams mission is to beat the competition by improving the user experience and explore new ways of creating value for the music marketeers in an increasingly competitive market. The application has many users and some of the application code could use an upgrade. 

**Team B** is working on building new products that utilize the knowledge and data from the SAAS Platform. The mission is to expand the market by building integrations that clients and partners can use as part of their own systems and websites. To do this Team B is using Team A's API and requesting changes when necessary.

## The task
It is your job to identify challenges the teams are facing and create a plan to achieve high performance teams. Use the information available to you to get an idea of the state of the two teams. There is **no requirement** to do statistical analysis, and you can apply your own assumptions for information you do not have.

### 1. Analyse the problem.
Identify the main challenges you see in and between the two teams. In your experience what could be the cause of the situation and what impact is it having on the teams and the company? What could some of the consquences be of this situation?

### 2. Present a plan for addressing the challenges identified.
Based on your analysis, present a plan on how to improve the state of each of the teams. In your plan consider the changes you would want to see and how you expect to make those changes. You can use any format of presentation that you are comfortable with.
